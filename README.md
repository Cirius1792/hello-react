# Hello React

This is my first React App, I tried to keep it simple while still using some of the basic concepts I learnt about React. 

What you will find in this simple app: 
1. **React Router**:
    1. To route between the main page and the "about me" page
    2. To set the name in the main page by retrieving the query parameter
2. **React state hook**: to manage the input validation while customizing the name and to show/hide the input section when clicking the gear icon
3. **Redux**: to persist the choice of the font and the name as to use the same font in the About Me page
4. **React Lazy Loading**: to reduce the amount of data loaded by the client, assuming that the About Me page will suffer from less traffic that the main page

Maybe, redux is an over kill for an application as simple as that, but the goal was to make practice!
